# **Aircraft Safety Insights Report ✈️**  

## **About This Project 🚀**  

The **Aircraft Safety Insights Report** is a comprehensive **data analysis project** that explores historical **aircraft crash data spanning several decades**. The goal is to uncover **patterns, trends, and key insights** related to aviation safety, including **fatality rates, survival trends, high-risk manufacturers, and geographic distributions of incidents**.  

This project leverages **Python** and popular **data analytics libraries** to transform raw data into actionable insights through **visualizations and statistical analysis**.
